# Day 2

Tue Dec  3 20:18:19 -03 2024: This is not first puzzle I solve. I have already
solved day 1, but I commited my input; something is not allowed. I have deleted
the old repository and now starting this new one.

I wanted to stick to Atari Basic but getting a emulator to run was impossible
and even if I managed to run one, I was not sure how to share a folder between
the guest and the host.

I opted to use DOSBox and downloaded a copy of GW-BASIC 3.23. It is a different
experience to not use vim and that the cursor replaces by default instead of
inserting new text. Hopefully I'll keep writing all code in it.

The worst part has been how to read the input from a file. I could have use a
`DATA` statement but that would mean commiting the input with the source code.
